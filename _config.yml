description: **Hi there! My name is Faniel Yemane.** I am currently a student studying electrical engineering at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. I enjoy creating interactive programs, designing and building engineering tools, and experimenting with microelectronics. I hope to specialize in software or EDA in the future, and I constantly work towards that goal every single day, be it through my studies or my side projects. When I'm not playing around with computers, you can find me enjoying some good films and playing saxophone. And a student too!
